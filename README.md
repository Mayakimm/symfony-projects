# Projects Overview

After graduating from Le Wagon's Fullstack Development Bootcamp, I took a Symfony 7 & PHP MVC course on Udemy to further develop my skills. During the course, I completed two projects to practice and solidify my knowledge. One project was mandatory for course completion, while the second was a voluntary project to deepen my understanding of the concepts.
